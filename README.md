This system integrates IoT, cloud storage, machine learning, and a responsive web interface to create a real-time smart agricultural solution.

ðŸ§© System Workflow

1.â€ƒThe ESP32 microcontroller collects real-time data from:
â€ƒ- Soil Moisture Sensor (moisture level)
â€ƒ- TCS3200 Color Sensor (RGB â†’ converted to NPK values using normalized RGB formula)

2.â€ƒNPK conversion formula:
â€ƒ\`\`\`math
â€ƒRnorm = R / (R + G + B)
â€ƒGnorm = G / (R + G + B)
â€ƒBnorm = B / (R + G + B)

â€ƒN (%) = (Rnorm Ã— 100) â€“ 10
â€ƒP (%) = (Gnorm Ã— 100) â€“ 5
â€ƒK (%) = (Bnorm Ã— 100) â€“ 8
â€ƒ\`\`\`

3.â€ƒData is pushed to Firebase Realtime Database using HTTP and MQTT.

4.â€ƒLive crop images are captured using an ESP32-CAM when the user clicks the capture button on the dashboard and are uploaded to Firebase for monitoring.

5.â€ƒThe L298N motor driver controls the irrigation pump:
â€ƒ- In Manual Mode: The pump can be toggled ON/OFF from the dashboard.
â€ƒ- In Auto Mode: The system schedules irrigation using crop-specific moisture values and real-time weather forecasts from OpenWeatherMap API to avoid unnecessary watering.

6.â€ƒAll data is visualized and controlled through a responsive HTML/CSS/JS dashboard.

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Crop Recommendation

An ML engine built using RandomForestClassifier helps suggest suitable crops based on soil and climate conditions.

* Developed in Google Colab
* Hosted via a Flask REST API
* Deployed model is serialized using Joblib (.pkl)

ðŸ§  Input Features:

* Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
* Temperature (Â°C)
* Humidity (%)
* Season (Summer, Monsoon, Winter â†’ encoded)

ðŸª´ Output:

* Top 5 crops with confidence scores
* Displayed as a list and a probability bar chart on the website

ðŸ”§ ML Stack:

| Tool         | Purpose                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Flask        | Backend API to serve model     |
| Flask-CORS   | Enable frontend-backend comms  |
| Pandas       | Data preprocessing             |
| Scikit-learn | Model training (Random Forest) |
| Joblib       | Model serialization (.pkl)     |
| Google Colab | Cloud training environment     |

ðŸ§ª Dataset Processing:

* Missing values and outliers handled statistically
* Categorical variables (e.g., crop, season) encoded
* Scaled and normalized for consistency
* 80/20 train-test split

ðŸŒ² Random Forest Config:

* n\_estimators: 100
* max\_depth: None
* criterion: gini
* random\_state: 42

ðŸŽ¯ Model Performance:
