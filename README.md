Snables remod leveumidity. The irrigation system supports both manual and automated scheduling based on crop requirements and weather forecasts. A web dashboard allows farmers to monitor field data, control the water pump, and make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and resource efficiency.
SmartGrow is an IoT and Machine Learning–based smart agriculture system that enables remote crop monitoring and intelligent irrigation. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with soil moisture and TCS3200 sensors to collect real-time data, and leverages Firebase for cloud storage and control. A machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) recommends suitable crops based on environmental factors like NPK values, temperature, and humidity. The irrigation system supports both manual and automated scheduling based on crop requirements and weather forecasts. A web dashboard allows farmers to monitor field data, control the water pump, and make data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and resource efficiency.SmartGrow is an IoT and Machine Learning–based smart agriculture system that enables remote crop monitoring and intelligent irrigation.
